# 3s-Unity-Shaders-Scripts

Scripts:

ChangeMaterial.cs allows you to change materials to a different shader without changing their renderqueue to the new shaders.

ShaderPreProcessor.cs removes Post Processing shaders (since they are provided) and unused passes from shaders before uploading reducing build size and build time

BakeEdgeLength.cs (WIP) allows you to bake a SkinnedMeshRenderers Edge Lengths to a texture for use with TensionMap.Shader


Shaders:

TensionMap.shader (WIP)

Various shaders I made/edited for friends
